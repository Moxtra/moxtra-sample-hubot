# moxtra-sample-hubot

This is a sample of a [Hubot][hubot-link] using [Moxtra's adapter][MoxAdapter].

moxtra-sample-hubot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.
It also uses [Moxtra's adapter][MoxAdapter] to connect your Hubot to your 
[Moxtra's account][moxtra].

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality is
available, etc!
